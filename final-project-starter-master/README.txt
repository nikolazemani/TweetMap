Notes about the project:

1. I did ALL the 6 steps for the project

2. I did 30 refactorings, all of which are outlined in the .txt file with the name "RefactoringSoftwareProject.txt", in this folder

3. I did testing for about 60 percent of the project (except for the ui and query packages). Since 60 percent was the requirement for the previous System Analysis project, I thought it 
would make sense for this one to be 60 percent too

4. I used Mockito to mock the ICordinate class when measuring the distanceBetween() method

5. UML photos are present in this same folder, one of them(the ui UML class diagram) is taken from InteliJ, since I learned you can extract the UML class diagram of a package from within
IntelliJ

6. Unfortunately, as you can see from the "twitterAPIEmail.png" file in this folder, I applied for a twitter developer since July 13th and never got an email back from them, so I had to
get on of my classmates' API Authentication Info
